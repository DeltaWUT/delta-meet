# delta-meet

## About

Initial phase of the project is to create a web application that allows users to find the best time to meet with their friends. The application will allow users to create an event and invite their friends to it. The application will then find the best time to meet with all the friends. The application will also allow users to create a poll to find the best time to meet with their friends.
